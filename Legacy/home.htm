    to the Oshkosh Gaming Society's Website.</strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
    meet every Tuesday night during the semester at 6 pm Tuesdays in Reeve Memorial 
    Union. The purpose of our organization is to have people that are interested 
    in various forms of games get together and enjoy them with other members of 
    the group. We have in the past played a vast array of different types of games 
    form chess and go to historical board games (Axis and Allies and its variants 
    are the most popular with us), to roll playing games like Dungeons and Dragons 
    or GURPS, to live action role playing ( most of us are also involved with 
    Amtgard, a live action role playing game Sundays at 1 pm) and other such diversions.

  <p align="left"><strong><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
    you consider yourself to be a gamer, than by all means, feel free to stop 
    by Tuesday nights and see what we're all about.</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
    also run roleplaying campaigns and other types of games during the rest of 
    the week. You can see what those are under the Campaigns section of the menu 
    to the left. Feel free to navigate through this site and maybe you just might 
    find something of interest. </font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks 
    for stopping in. Come back again to see what we're doing.</font></strong></p>
